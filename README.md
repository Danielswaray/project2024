This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial. I will also go over the step by step for each section in our subsequent sessions.

I also, encourage you all to practice the demo and watch the videos before each class. This class requires dedication in the form of a handson so please take note.
